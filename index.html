                <h2 class="Image_title">Classic Camille</h2>
                <p>Weaponized to operate outside the boundaries of the law, Camille is the Principal Intelligencer of
                    Clan
                    Ferros—an
                    elegant and elite agent who ensures the Piltover machine and its Zaunite underbelly run smoothly.
                    Adaptable
                    and precise,
                    she views sloppy technique as an embarrassment that must be put to order. With a mind as sharp as
                    the
                    blades
                    she bears,
                    Camille's pursuit of superiority through hextech body augmentation has left many to wonder if she is
                    now
                    more machine
                    than human.

                <p>They came to Camille as if in some dark slumber—whispers of the Ebony Ram, and the nameless things
                    tumbling
                    up from
                    long-forgotten sepulchers. Her throat full of hearsay, she cuts down the vestiges of the new world,
                    seeding
                    the earth
                    with the magics and witchery of her ancient, grinning masters.

                <h2 class="Image_title">Program Camille</h2>
                <p>Weaponized to quell the G/NETIC rebellion, Program Camille is a robotic assassin who will kill any
                    human
                    trying to
                    utilize unauthorized technology. A being of adaptable protocols and laser-like focus, she takes her
                    orders
                    directly from
                    Program's superior artificial intelligence.

                <h2 class="Image_title">Stargazer Camille</h2>
                <p>Only the most powerful Stargazers can see the threads of fate; of those, only Camille knows how to
                    weave
                    (and
                    cut) them
                    as she pleases. She leads the order with a cold passion for the job and an unending thirst for
                    knowledge,
                    though she
                    long ago lost touch with her humanity and barely remembers why people are worth protecting.

                <p>Assist Director Camille really wanted more say in the creative direction of the performance. Now
                    trapped
                    within the
                    paper world of the play, Camille finally gets to make the cuts and directional changes she’s had in
                    mind.

                <h2 class="Image_title">Fiend Queller Camille</h2>
                <p>One of the leaders of the four elite houses, Camille relies on ironfisted methods to run the city's
                    places of
                    worship.
                    To her, Yone's inclination for appeasement would never succeed in purging evil from the city. To
                    ensure
                    enduring peace
                    and stability in the city, she stands ready to cut down any threat that dares encroach, including
                    creatures
                    of the demon
                    realm and even those who wield magic powers without the houses' permission.
